<h6>My Dream House </h6>
<p> My dream house would have a small garden where <b>I will grow my own vegetables and fruits</b>. 
    The house that I fancy would be considerably big with four rooms and a spacious common area.
     <b>My dream house should be comfortable for my parents, grandparents and siblings</b>.
    It has lots of rooms and windows and big red front door. 
    There is a huge living room with comfortable sofas and enormous TV screen on the wall for my family and I to spend time together. 
    In the basement, there is a giant game room with a ping-pong table and drum set for me and my friends.</p>

<h4>Food Recommendation</h4>
<p>The below table has the food recommendations in maryville city. My personal choice would be chicka-chicka boom-boom which is available in  chuys,chicken nuggets at walmart are delicious. For dinner chicken Biryani at Godavari is tasty with great aroma. Lastly, a shot of oreo chocolate which is found in sonic would complete the day.</p>

You can search for the rank using Gaussian elimination. We will perform the same operations as when solving the system or finding its determinant. 
But if at any step in the i-th column there are no rows with an non-empty entry among those that we didn't selected already, then we skip this step. 
Otherwise, if we have found a row with a non-zero element in the i-th column during the i-th step, then we mark this row as a selected one, increase 
the rank by one (initially the rank is set equal to 0), and perform the usual operations of taking this row away from the rest.
the algorithm runs in O(n3).For more info<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-rank-of-matrix/"> Click Here</a></blockquote>
